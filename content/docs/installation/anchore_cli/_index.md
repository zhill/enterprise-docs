In this section you will learn how to install and configure the Anchore CLI. The Anchore CLI provides a command line interface on top of the REST API. THe Anchore CLI is published as a Python Package that can be installed from source from the Python PyPI package repository on any platform supporting PyPi. Using the Anchore CLI users can manage and inspect images, policies, subscriptions, and registries. 

You can view the Anchore CLI on [Github](https://github.com/anchore/anchore-cli) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/anchore/engine-cli/).

#### Setting the Path

Once installed the anchore-cli utility has been installed you may need to adjust your PATH to ensure that the anchore-cli executable is in the user's path.

The install location is system dependent, governed by PIP and may vary based the distribution on which you are running.
The most common default locations are:

- **Apple macOS:** $HOME/Library/Python/2.7/bin
- **Linux:** $/HOME/.local/bin

You can verify the install location by running the following command:

```
$ python -m site --user-base
/home/myusername/.local
```

Executable files installed by pip --user will be placed in the bin sub directory.
