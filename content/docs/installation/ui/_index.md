## Introduction

The Enterprise UI is a stand-alone component that is included with Anchore Enterprise, and is installed by default when deploying a trial quickstart (with docker-compose) or a production deployment (with Helm or other).  

- [Docker Compose]({{< ref "/docs/installation/docker_compose" >}})
- [Kubernetes]({{< ref "/docs/installation/helm" >}})

Many Enterprise UI configuration options are done via the UI interface itself, but there are some static system settings that you may wish to modify depending on your deployment (the default configuration is designed such that modifying the UI configuration is not required).
