## Introduction

In this section, you'll learn how to get up and running with a stand-alone Anchore Engine installation for trial, demonstration and review with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Requirements

The following instructions assume you are using a system running Docker v1.12 or higher, and a version of Docker Compose that supports at least v2 of the docker-compose configuration format.

* A stand-alone installation will requires at least 4GB of RAM, and enough disk space available to support the largest container images you intend to analyze (we recommend 3x largest container image size).  For small images/testing (basic Linux distro images, database images, etc), between 5GB and 10GB of disk space should be sufficient.


### Step 1: Setup installation location

Create a directory in which to store your configuration files.
```
mkdir ~/aevolume
cd ~/aevolume
```

### Step 2: Copy configuration files

Download the latest Anchore Engine container image, which contains the necessary `docker-compose.yaml` and configuration files that the deployment requires.
```
# docker pull docker.io/anchore/anchore-engine:latest
```

Next, copy the included docker-compose.yaml to the ~/aevolume/ directory.

```
# docker create --name ae docker.io/anchore/anchore-engine:latest
# docker cp ae:/docker-compose.yaml ~/aevolume/docker-compose.yaml
# docker rm ae
```

Once these steps are complete, your ~/aevolume/ workspace should now look like this:

```
# ls ~/aevolume
docker-compose.yaml
```

### Step 3: Download and run the containers

Download the containers listed in the `docker-compose.yaml`, and run the entire setup using the docker-compose CLI.
NOTE: by default, all services (including a bundled DB instance) will be transient, and data will be lost if you shut down/restart

```
# cd ~/aevolume
# docker-compose pull
# docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Verify service availability

After a few moments (depending on system speed), your Anchore Engine services should be up and running, ready to use.  You can verify the containers are running with docker-compose:

```
# cd ~/aevolume
# docker-compose ps
                Name                               Command               State           Ports
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
aevolume_anchore-db_1                   docker-entrypoint.sh postgres    Up      5432/tcp
aevolume_engine-analyzer_1              /docker-entrypoint.sh anch ...   Up      8228/tcp
aevolume_engine-api_1                   /docker-entrypoint.sh anch ...   Up      0.0.0.0:8228->8228/tcp
aevolume_engine-catalog_1               /docker-entrypoint.sh anch ...   Up      8228/tcp
aevolume_engine-policy-engine_1         /docker-entrypoint.sh anch ...   Up      8228/tcp
aevolume_engine-simpleq_1               /docker-entrypoint.sh anch ...   Up      8228/tcp
```

You can run a command to get the status of the Anchore Engine services:

```
# cd ~/aevolume
# docker-compose exec engine-api anchore-cli system status
Service policy_engine (anchore-quickstart, http://engine-policy-engine:8228): up
Service simplequeue (anchore-quickstart, http://engine-simpleq:8228): up
Service catalog (anchore-quickstart, http://engine-catalog:8228): up
Service analyzer (anchore-quickstart, http://engine-analyzer:8228): up
Service apiext (anchore-quickstart, http://engine-api:8228): up

Engine DB Version: 0.0.10
Engine Code Version: 0.4.0
```

**Note:** The first time you run Anchore Engine, it will take some time (10+ minutes, depending on network speed) for the vulnerability data to get synced into the engine.  For the best experience, wait until the core vulnerability data feeds have completed before proceeding.  You can check the status of your feed sync using the CLI:

```
# cd ~/aevolume
# docker-compose exec engine-api anchore-cli system feeds list
Feed                   Group                  LastSync                           RecordCount

```

As soon as you see RecordCount values > 0 for all vulnerability groups, the system is fully populated and ready to present vulnerability results.   Note that feed syncs are incremental, so the next time you start up Anchore Engine it will be ready immediately.  The CLI tool includes a useful utility that will block until the feeds have completed a successful sync:

```
# docker-compose exec engine-api anchore-cli system wait
Starting checks to wait for anchore-engine to be available timeout=-1.0 interval=5.0
API availability: Checking anchore-engine URL (http://localhost:8228)...
API availability: Success.
Service availability: Checking for service set (catalog,apiext,policy_engine,simplequeue,analyzer)...
Service availability: Success.
Feed sync: Checking sync completion for feed set (vulnerabilities)...
Feed sync: Checking sync completion for feed set (vulnerabilities)...
...
...
Feed sync: Success.

```

### Step 5: Begin using Anchore

Start using the anchore-engine service to analyze images - a short example follows which demonstrates a basic workflow of adding a container image for analysis, waiting for the analysis to complete, then running content reports, vulnerability scans and policy evaluations against the analyzed image.

```
# docker-compose exec engine-api anchore-cli image add docker.io/library/debian:7
...
...

# docker-compose exec engine-api anchore-cli image wait docker.io/library/debian:7
Status: analyzing
Waiting 5.0 seconds for next retry.

Waiting 5.0 seconds for next retry.

**Note:** This document is intended to serve as a quickstart guide. Before moving further with Anchore to explore the scanning, policy evaluation, image content reporting, CI/CD integrations and other capabilities, it is highly recommended that you enhance your learning by reading the [Overview]({{< ref "/docs/engine/general" >}}) sections to gain a deeper understanding of fundamentals, concepts, and proper usage.

### Next Steps

Now that you have Anchore Engine running, you can begin to learning more about Anchore Architecture, Anchore Concepts and Anchore Usage.
